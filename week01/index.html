            Hello! My name is Miguel Arias and I was born in Quito, Eduador.<br>
            I have been a member of the church since I was eight years old and I served a mission in the Colombia Medellin Mission, from which I returned one year ago.<br>
            I enjoy a lot listening to music and playing guitar. I try to play songs from my favorite bands, like Metallica and Guns N' Roses.<br>
            I'm excited about creating web pages in html; even though this is my first time learning how to do it, I am enjoying a lot! ðŸ˜Ž
